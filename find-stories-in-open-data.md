*Stop using your computer, start with using your brain to find stories in data.*


# wtf?


Public data will never help you find great stories but can be a precious help
if you know how to deal with it.


Because public data is like press releases.


*Disclaimer*

## ok what data are we talking about here
- https://www.regionalstatistik.de/genesis/online/
- https://www.offenesdatenportal.de/organization/moers


# what is a story

a recent *thing* going on told in an understandable and entertaining way.


# what is an even better story

a recent *thing* going on told in an understandable and entertaining way.

a story,
- that the user didn't know before
- that flashes the user
- that takes the user on a journey of adventures
- that is *true*


## the ingredients

- people
- places
- process
- changes
- journey
- truth
- ...


## what datasets can provide
- numbers


## oh wait, something about data...
- uncomplete
- malformatet
- outdated
- unusable


## it's even worse...
- biased
- filtered
- manipulated


# data is not a reliable source for anything



# but what you can get out of numbers
hints for...
- places
- process
- changes

**what to really investigate further.**

*(therefore a bit of data analyzing skills can be helpful.)*


# 2 bios of a data story

data -> topic

topic -> data


# a dataset is not a story itself
it's just one of many ingredients.

it's just one of many research sources.



# ok, but what should i do then


## from a dataset to a story
- find dataset
- find maybe other datasets
- look at the numbers
- ask the questions the numbers raise
- find the answers somewhere else
- find the story ingredients
- evolve the story


# hmmyeah, i still want some practical tips

## analyze the numbers

## treat your datasets as a human source
